# s3ntim3ntal
submission for hackathon, sentimental analysis of reviews for entrepreneurs who need to focus their time on the startup
link to colab for demo: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_P18k4UeUuW54KfruK4llmlCSUJNrOfl?usp=sharing

instructions:
the model is too big to upload to github, so you need to: 
* go to the Colab and generate your own model following the steps there
* once you have the model, just download main.py (keep in same directory as model), and then run main.py to test the model with your own input
* if you dont want all that, feel free to just look at the ipynb file and see how the model is created and used

(EDIT: the model is linked here for download: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BnYfuBo_RmYn7c1_1Er9F93Tq27_JSfw/view?usp=sharing)\
Kaggle Database: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews?resource=download\
will add link to replit where model and program are located together, to allow super easy demo use
